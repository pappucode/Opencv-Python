What is image?
An image is the binary representation of visual information, such as drawing, pictures, graphs, logos or individual videos frames.

Images can be rsized in plenty of way. Here I have mentioned some of them.

1) Preserve Aspect Ratio (the ratio of height and width is preserved). 
	1.1) Downscale (Decresase the size of the image)
	1.2) Upscale (Increase the size of the image)

2) Do not preserve Aspact ratio
	2.1) Resize the width individually. 
	2.2) Resize the height Individually.
